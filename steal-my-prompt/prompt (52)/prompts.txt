A hyperrealistic conceptual portrait of a young woman with short, structured hair, captured in a cinematic studio with painterly light and surreal motion blur. She stands with her body facing forward, head tilted slightly downward, eyes closed or softened suspended in a moment of quiet introspection. Her blouse is a lightweight, semi-sheer white fabric with a soft neckline and delicate buttons, evoking romantic restraint. The environment is studio-bound but sculptural the background a deep, desaturated navy that falls away into darkness. Lighting is dramatically directional: a split of cool blue shadows and warm, golden side-light grazes the right side of her face and garment, illuminating skin with cinematic intensity. The glow spills across her clavicle and blouse, exaggerating transparency and form. The image captures layered motion: her face appears twice, ghosted with a smooth trail of warm blur stretching backward in profile as if her presence is echoing through time. This motion effect blends long-exposure logic with digital polish, creating a psychological ripple. The ghost image glows slightly orange, as if it exists within a separate plane of light. Her skin is treated with soft realism: subtle micro pore texture across the nose and cheeks, translucent lid sheen, and faint lip diffusion. Light bloom halos around her facial contours, and a low film grain overlays the entire composition. Chromatic aberration subtly disrupts the edge of the ghosted motion trail, and a faint dust haze diffuses the contrast. Camera is set at eye-level using a 50mm lens with shallow depth of field. Focus is fixed on her still face, while the motion-blur echo fades softly into the dark. No sharp edges only gradients of presence and absence. Mood: suspended, cinematic, ghosted memory like a moment bleeding into itself. --ar 4:5 --raw --stylize 1000
