Shot on a Phase One XF IQ4 with a 110mm lens at f/3.2, captured during a slow pivot that melts the
subject into a swirling halo. Lighting is a cold LED wash softened by desert haze, bending into
pastel motion. The figure’s hands blur into long spectral trails while the face remains a fleeting
anchor. Random calligraphic scribbles flicker along the edges of the frame like someone writing on
glass mid-exposure. Tone: brushed steel, pale dusk, ink black. --ar 4:5 --raw
