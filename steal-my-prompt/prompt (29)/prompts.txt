 "prompt": "High-fashion sports campaign, dark cinematic aesthetic. Medium close-up
studio portrait of a female tennis player, styled as a luxury fashion editorial. The model is
photographed straight-on, directly facing the camera, positioned precisely in the center
of the frame. Only half of her face is visible due to controlled shadow, while the other
half fades into deep darkness. She holds a Wilson tennis racket vertically in front of her
face; the string bed aligns centrally and partially obscures her features, acting as a
geometric grid. One visible eye is sharp, intense, and piercing, looking directly into the
lens through the strings, while the foreground strings remain softly out of focus. The
setting is a very dark room with minimal ambient light. Lighting is sculptural and precise:
a subtle overhead beauty dish shapes only the illuminated half of her face, leaving the
other side in near-black shadow. No neon light touches the model. In the background, a
soft, abstract bokeh emerges from darkness, intersected by a single diIused neon light
beam or streak (cool-toned cyan or magenta) passing behind her, atmospheric and out
of focus. The background remains deep, dark, and cinematic. Composition is centered
and symmetrical in framing, yet visually tense due to the half-face reveal. Mediumformat photography look inspired by Hasselblad H6D, 100mm portrait lens, shallow
depth of field, f/4 aesthetic. Editorial color grading with muted skin tones, deep blacks,
controlled highlights, matte finish, crisp eye detail, and subtle cinematic film grain.
Moody, modern, avant-garde luxury tennis campaign vibe.",
