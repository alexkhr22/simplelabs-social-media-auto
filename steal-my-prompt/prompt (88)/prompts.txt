Male model in oversized stone-gray linen suit standing
inside an abandoned warehouse, late-afternoon shafts
of sunlight through dusty windows. Skin tone neutral
olive with visible pores, soft sweat film on temple
catching rim light, detailed arm hair on forearm.
Lighting: single key from high window + fill from
reflected concrete floor, contrast ratio 3:1. Shot on
Leica SL2-S + 50mm f/1.4 Summilux, ISO 200, shutter
1/320. Texture fidelity: crisp denim fibers, accurate
subsurface scattering, muted cinematic palette --
