Prompt-
Ultra-realistic cinematic street-fashion photograph, landscape frame (≈ 736×596), shot at golden

hour with warm low sunlight and long shadows. Scene: a quiet European street in autumn with
dense orange/burnt-amber trees filling the upper background, a black wrought-iron fence running
horizontally behind the subjects, and a grey historic townhouse façade with ornate details and tall
windows. On the right side background, include a white Italian street sign mounted on a pole with a
blue circle symbol and readable text layout similar to: “Comune di Milano” at top and “passo
carrabile” in bold lower section (small date/code line underneath). Behind the fence, partially visible
dark parked car (front lights and grille hinted), deep shadows under trees.

Foreground: a classic burgundy / deep wine-red vintage coupe (classic Porsche 911 style) parked
parallel to camera, viewed from the side at a slight angle, with glossy maroon paint, chrome trim,
tan/caramel interior, and a visible rear wheel with classic 5-petal/fuchs-style rim. Driver door is
open or being held open; the male subject is positioned at the left foreground beside the door,
interacting with it.

Male subject (left foreground): young adult, light skin, slim build, average height; short brown hair
with a neat side part, clean face, calm serious expression. Pose: leaning forward from the waist
toward camera, left shoulder slightly dipped, head tilted subtly, gaze directed toward camera with a
cool detached look. Outfit: dark chocolate/brown long overcoat (structured, minimal), underneath a
deep burgundy/maroon shirt (matte fabric), and very wide-leg dark trousers that drape heavily;

edge, female centered-right; autumn trees and building fill the top background. Depth: crisp
foreground subjects and car, background moderately soft but still readable (sign legible, fence
clear). No extra people. No modern clutter.

Lighting: natural golden sunlight from camera-right, creating warm highlights on faces, coat edges,
and car paint; soft falloff into cooler shadows. Color grade: warm autumn highlights + neutral/cool
shadows, subtle cinematic contrast, clean skin texture, realistic pores, no plastic look. Texture
emphasis: wool coat weave, trench fabric creases, glossy car reflections, iron fence detail, leaves
dense and crisp.

Camera realism: 85mm look, eye-level to slightly below eye-level, mild background compression,

editorial street photography. Settings feel: f/2.8–f/4, fast shutter, ISO low. Output: hyper-

against the corner edge of an old European building facade. Composition is perfectly centered
vertically with lots of negative space above the subject; subject placed slightly right of the dark
doorway. Background: on the left, a tall, matte very-dark green/black double door with recessed
rectangular panels; above the door a narrow horizontal band with vertical decorative grooves and a
clean white number “6” centered on that band. The door has a vertical metal handle/lock plate on

teal/green-painted wooden windows with divided panes: one window in the upper-right quadrant
(two columns of panes), and another window in the lower-right quadrant (darker interior reflection,
grid panes). A rounded arch cutout separates the dark doorway area from the beige wall above the
subject’s head, creating a curved negative-space shape.

left trouser pocket, right hand holding a medium-large structured brown leather handbag with
darker brown flap pockets on the front; bag has short handles and a white cloth/scarf visibly stuffed
inside the opening. Footwear: black leather loafers (slightly chunky) on cobblestone pavement.

Environment & ground: foreground is a cobblestone street and sidewalk with a curb; a thin worn
yellow paint marking runs along the street edge near the bottom of frame; a small rectangular metal
object/drain detail near bottom center. No other people or vehicles visible. Mood is quiet, minimal,
European old-town street.

Lighting: soft overcast daylight, diffused shadows, low contrast, natural color, no harsh highlights.
Color palette: muted neutrals—deep green-black door, beige wall, teal window frames, cream
trousers, brown bag; subtle film-like tonality, very light grain.

Camera & framing: portrait orientation, eye-level to slightly above waist-level viewpoint, medium-
wide framing capturing full body plus ample architecture; subject fully in frame with extra

headroom; straight-on perspective, minimal lens distortion. Sharp focus on subject and immediate
facade textures, background still crisp (not heavy bokeh). High-resolution, realistic skin texture,
realistic fabric weave (knit ribbing and blazer wool), realistic leather sheen on gloves and bag.

• Mountains: Mid-to-far background shows a layered mountain range with heavy snow
coverage, blue-gray rock faces peeking through. Main peak sits slightly left of center; ridgelines
cascade rightward.
• Weather / particles: Light snowfall with floating bokeh snow specks across foreground and
sky (some larger, softly out-of-focus circles).
• Light: Bright winter sun from upper right, giving warm highlights on snow and strong long
shadows. Overall grade is slightly warm in highlights, cool in shadows (cinematic winter palette).
• Subject (woman):
• Blonde hair, straight, shoulder length, slightly wind-swept.
• Wearing an oversized long white fur coat (very plush texture, hem near calves).
• Bottoms: pale lavender / mauve wide-leg trousers (soft drape).
• Pose: body angled away down the road, head turned back over left shoulder toward
camera; calm, confident expression.
• A long, crisp shadow stretches toward the camera on the snow.
• Car (foreground right):
• A vintage red convertible sports car in front 3/4 view (front-right corner closest to
camera).
• Snow dusting on hood and windshield edge; tiny snow speckles on paint.
• Distinct round headlight, chrome bumper details; low classic silhouette.
• Windshield visible with a light frosty/snowy edge; interior hinted.
• Composition: Woman placed left-third, car dominates right-third. Road creates a strong
leading line toward mountains.

Prompt-
Composition / framing: near-square frame (slightly taller than wide). Top-down / overhead view,

subject placed slightly below center inside a large circular snow depression that fills the entire
frame. Strong natural vignette from the darker, bluish snow edges toward the brighter center.
• Environment: pure snow surface sculpted like a bowl/arena. Snow texture shows soft
wind-swept ridges and compressed footprints/drag marks, especially around the circle’s perimeter.
No sky visible; it’s a studio-like outdoor snow set.
• Lighting: soft, diffused daylight (overcast feel). Cool shadows, gentle contrast. Brightest
area is the center-right where the snow looks more packed and reflective. Minimal specular
highlights; everything is matte.
• Subject pose: person lying on back like a relaxed snow-angel pose but not symmetrical:
• Both arms stretched wide horizontally, palms relaxed, fingers slightly spread.
• Left leg bent at the knee, opened outward, revealing a bare thigh.
• Right leg extended downward with the right boot angled so the brown lug sole is clearly
visible.
• Wardrobe: monochrome winter fashion:
• White oversized fluffy faux-fur hooded coat (hood up), plush texture with thick pile.
• Matching white fluffy shorts/skirt-like bottom (also faux-fur), exposing one thigh.
• White socks (mid-calf) on both legs.
• White winter boots with clean uppers; right boot shows brown tread sole.
• Face / head: face framed by the fluffy hood, small portion visible, neutral expression, eyes
appear relaxed/partially closed, looking upward toward camera.
• Extra set detail: near the subject’s right side (upper-right of body) there’s a secondary
snow impression resembling a head/shoulder-shaped indentation, like a sculpted hollow beside
them.
• Color grade: icy whites + cool blue-gray shadows; very subtle film grain/texture; editorial
fashion look.

Create a hyper-real, high-fashion winter editorial portrait in clean studio-like snow light.

A young fair-skinned subject in perfect right-facing side profile, placed on the right third of a
portrait 3:4 frame, leaving wide negative space of soft white snow background on the right. The
subject wears a white ribbed knit balaclava/ski hood (vertical rib texture clearly visible), with an

oversized pair of white-framed snow goggles sitting on top of the balaclava. The goggles have a
thick black strap wrapping around the head and a single large mirrored grey lens showing tiny snow
specks/condensation dots on the lens surface.
Skin details must be ultra-real: fine freckles across the cheek and nose bridge, cold pink cheek
flush, natural pores, soft matte lips, and a calm neutral expression. The subject wears a cream/white
shearling or plush faux-fur winter coat filling the lower half of frame, with a thick fluffy white fur
collar/trim sweeping behind the jawline; include a small black drawcord detail near the neck
opening.
Background is an empty, high-key, overcast snowfield look with no horizon, no objects, extremely
smooth, soft falloff, slightly warm ivory tone.
Lighting is diffused overcast snow light, shadowless, clean highlights, gentle facial modeling, no
harsh contrast. Camera feel: premium fashion editorial, crisp but soft, realistic fabric fibers, realistic
lens reflections, minimal grain, no stylization, no extra accessories.
