Full-body fashion portrait in a pristine white cyclorama — model stands in contrapposto tilt, weight on one leg, S-curve posture. Framed with a 50mm lens at mid-height, balanced composition. The soft key light wraps the subject in diffuse glow, casting feathered shadows on the white floor. Accessories glint in controlled specular bloom. Skin catches micro pore detail and subsurface glow on fingertips. Film grain drifts gently through the highlights. Dust haze gives atmospheric volume. Rich elegance within minimalist clarity.
