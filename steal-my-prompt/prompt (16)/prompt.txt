Three-quarter composition — model seated atop coastal cliff edge, body reclined in soft twist, gaze
angled off-frame. Captured with a 50mm lens, f/2.2 for moderate depth. Late sun spills amber light
across cheekbone and metallic earrings. Skin picks up freckles and subtle sheen. Wind pulls scarf
asymmetrically. Background bokeh softens rocky shoreline into visual texture. The mood: calm,
elite, untouchable.
