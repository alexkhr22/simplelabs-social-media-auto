 "prompt": "High-fashion cinematic close-up portrait of a Western woman with brown
hair and curtain bangs peeking out from a dark silver Baklava-style scarf. Her head fills
80% of the frame, looking directly at the camera with slightly sleepy eyes and full soft
orange lips. Fair skin with natural freckles. The scene is set in a field under a bright blue
sky just before sunset, creating a natural warm glow. Apply a subtle warm orange-brown
color tone across the image, enhancing vintage and editorial fashion vibes without any
borders, frames, or Polaroid-style edges. Bold, minimalistic Vogue magazine-style
composition, soft cinematic lighting highlighting facial features and metallic texture of
the scarf. Shot on Kodak film ISO 400 with a Leica camera, analog film aesthetic,
cinematic depth of field, polished editorial finish.",
