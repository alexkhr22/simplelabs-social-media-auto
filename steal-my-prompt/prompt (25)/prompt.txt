Framing / pose Mid-torso portrait, subject turned three-quarter left, shoulders angled; head subtly tilted forward and left, chin tucked. Shirtless; musculature defined but soft—deltoid, clavicle, and upper pectoral planes visible. Expression quiet, introspective; eyes toward camera but partially veiled by shadow.
Lighting Dark, cinematic low-key setup with a single narrow, warm beam (flash light) cutting diagonally from upper left to lower right. Beam grazes the left cheekbone/temple, creates a bright slit along jawline, then spills as molten highlights across collarbone and upper chest. Everything else kept in deep teal-green shadow; gentle haze/halation around the hot edge of the beam. Very soft negative fill on camera right; no rim. Contrast is high but rolled—highlight shoulder edges bloom slightly. Subject details
Medium-dark skin with bronze undertones; speculars catch golden where the beam hits, matte elsewhere. Hair: short, natural tight curls; top slightly fuller, edges soft against background. Subtle neck sinews and collarbone relief emphasized by the beam’s falloff; no jewelry, tattoos, or wardrobe. Background / palette / texture Seamless studio backdrop, moody blue-teal to deep green gradient (darker right/top, lighter left/bottom). Overall grade: warm amber highlights vs. cool teal shadows. Classic teal & orange in a subdued register. Smooth, clean digital texture with faint atmospheric bloom—no visible grain. Mood Dreamy, solitary, contemplative; feels like a shaft of sunset entering a dark room. Fashion-editorial minimalism with painterly chiaroscuro. —ar 4:5 —raw —stylize 1000
