Smooth paper-texture cream background, high contrast black portrait with slightly metallic skin

sheen, no props, emotion in eyes, scribbles covering the top + sides like notes of a studio wall, hip-
hop words, life quotes, slang, time stamps, cross-outs, quick circles layout feels like a brain dump

4K album visual. --ar 4:5 --raw

Washed warm background, central subject lit softly from one side creating sharp cheek shadow,
scribble text wrapping around the silhouette like smoke, phrases in mixed handwriting weights,
chaotic spacing, occasional doodles (stars, X marks, hearts crossed), gritty grain over entire frame,
calm but loud energy - album poster 4K. --ar 4:5 --raw

Portrait cropped from chest up, matte black clothing blending into background vignette, words
scattered in every direction like intrusive thoughts, some rotated, some overlapping, raw human
handwriting aesthetic, simple 2-tone palette, one bold title handwritten much larger imperfect but
beautiful high-res poster. --ar 4:5 --raw

Cream-tone background, center portrait of a rapper in black silhouette with glasses, cigarette or
toothpick in mouth, harsh top-light creating dramatic shadows, hand-written words and phrases
scattered around like diary thoughts, medium-thick marker texture, unbalanced but artistic
arrangement, raw minimal palette (black + off-white), high visual attitude - 4K album cover. --ar 4:5

Muted beige canvas, dark monochrome portrait, jacket collar high, one eyebrow up like questioning
life, messy pen texts around head like spiraling thoughts, short phrases, emotions, song titles,
arrows and circles, organic ink flow, no strong graphic shapes only handwriting and personality,
underground hip-hop tension - 4K square artwork. --ar 4:5 --raw --v 7
