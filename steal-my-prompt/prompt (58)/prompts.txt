A solitary figure standing on wet grass at dusk, holding a large duffel bag by the handles. The scene is bathed in a cinematic teal tone deep, moody atmosphere with cool gradients across sky, water, and fabric. The person wears oversized layered clothing, textured denim catching the faint shimmer of low light. Horizon low, vast sky dominating the frame, filled with faint stars and soft cloud streaks. Reflected teal hues ripple across the shallow water around their feet. Light direction from camera left, sculpting subtle highlights on cheekbones, fabric folds, and the bag’s contour. Quiet tension, still air, cinematic solitude. --no blur watermark text distorted faces logos --ar 4:5 --raw --stylize 1000
