Male model, mid-20s, sharp facial structure, light stubble,
short buzz haircut dusted with fine snow. Half-body portrait,
standing in cold outdoor environment with falling snowflakes.
The model is wearing an open winter jacket layered over a
textured wool sweater, relaxed yet strong posture, looking
straight toward camera with composed intensity. Camera &
Composition: shot on Fujifilm GFX100 medium-format, 85 mm
f/1.8 lens, half-body frame from waist up, slight low angle to
emphasize presence, shallow depth of field with gentle
background blur and snow bokeh. Lighting: natural overcast
daylight, soft diffused light with subtle rim reflection from
snow, balanced exposure to retain highlight detail in
snowflakes and shadow depth on clothing. Color & Tone: cool
cinematic palette—steel blue, charcoal grey, and skin
warmth contrasting the cold; mild matte grade with teal
shadows and desaturated highlights. Skin realism: ultra-
photorealistic skin, visible pores, fine vellus hair, natural
micro-sheen from cold air, small ice crystals and snow buzz
resting on eyebrows and hairline, subtle red undertones on
nose and ears, subsurface scattering at ear edges, fine film-
grain texture, no smoothing or retouching, anatomically clean
features and transitions. Environment: soft snowfall drifting
through frame, visible flakes near lens for depth, distant
blurred trees and frost tones in background, breath mist
faintly visible. Artistic direction: luxury winter editorial,
cinematic restraint, raw natural realism shot in the mood of
Prada Alpine or Louis Vuitton winter campaigns—minimal,
tactile, emotional. --chaos 5 --ar 3:4 --quality 4 --raw --
