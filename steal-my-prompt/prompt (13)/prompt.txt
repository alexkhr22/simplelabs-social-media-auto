Editorial photography, Eye Level, Medium Shot, A woman sitting in the backseat of a car, seen
through the window glass. She holds a reusable mint-green cup in her hand, wearing a blazer and
white top. Soft natural daylight filters through the glass, creating gentle reflections and a calm,
introspective mood. Captured with a Canon EOS R5, 50mm f/1.8 lens
