A woman with sculptural, symmetrical features and a hypermodern aesthetic. Her face is heart-
shaped, with high, sharply defined cheekbones tapering into a narrow, delicate jawline and soft,

rounded chin. The skin is porcelain-pale with cool undertones, nearly luminous under natural light.
Subsurface scattering glows subtly around the ears, neck creases, and nose base. Her skin is
impeccably smooth with minimal visible pores; matte in some regions (cheeks, temples), with a faint
oil reflectivity on the upper lip and nose bridge. Fine baby hair halos at the sideburns, nearly
imperceptible against the light backdrop.
Lips are full, symmetrical, with a tight vermillion border and satin finish — a soft coral-pink gradient
intensifies toward the center, showing slight natural chapping along the lower lip texture. Her nose
is refined, with a narrow bridge, subtle slope, and a softly upturned tip. Minimal nostril flare. Eyes
are almond-shaped with long upward lashes, dark and evenly spaced. The iris is pale green-gray,

semi-obscured behind pink-tinted acrylic lenses — reflections of the ambient light source trace
across both the lens surface and her moist cornea. Lashes cast subtle shadows against the lens
interior. Eyebrows are pencil-thin and sharply groomed, with high arches and a near-black pigment
contrasting starkly with platinum hair.
Hair is platinum white, cut in a hyper-precise, blunt microbob — straight across the brow with
consistent strand width. Each hair shaft exhibits ultra-fine silkiness, with high light reflectivity and
individual strand separation under directional lighting. No visible roots. The hair halo is soft and
sparse, fluttering behind the ears and nape. Ears are pierced with minimalist silver studs; natural
skin indentation and tension around the lobe create believable anatomical depth.
The neck and shoulder reveal a bold black ink tattoo: floral-meets-butterfly motif spanning the left
shoulder blade, with crisp edges and matte pigment, appearing healed and settled into the skin.
Another tattoo—a sharp, symmetrical graphic—emerges at the base of the nape, suggesting a
cohesive design language across the upper body. The skin around the collarbone is smooth,
tensioned slightly as she angles her head over her right shoulder in a confident, poised turn. Her
jaw is subtly engaged, mouth parted mid-breath. The posture implies presence, self-assured gaze,
and a surreal, editorial calm.
Lighting: Soft directional sunlight from camera right creates a bright, low-angle cast with diffused
spill over the left cheek and collarbone. Shadows are soft-edged and minimal, suggesting
environmental bounce. Slight gradient light falloff over the left temple. Pink lens tint refracts
ambient light, casting a gentle magenta hue on adjacent skin zones. No hard shadows or blown
highlights — image is exposure-balanced for soft highlight rolloff and midtone retention.
Camera: Captured on a mirrorless full-frame with a 100mm macro lens at f/2.0, tightly cropped.
Shallow depth of field isolates the subject against a seamless matte eggshell white background.
Focus plane is perfectly resolved on her right eye, with lens-induced falloff into shoulder blur. The
image bears no compression or warping; focal length renders realistic facial proportions with
minimal edge stretch. Bokeh is smooth and neutral.
Environment: Indoor minimalist studio with no visible props — seamless matte white wall forms
clean background. Light spill from adjacent surfaces creates an ambient bounce. No dust, haze, or
particle texture. Slight tonal vignette in corners adds subtle depth.
