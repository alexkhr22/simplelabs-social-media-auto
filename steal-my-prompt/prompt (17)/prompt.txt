Prompt -

Three-quarter editorial capture — angular power stance with legs rooted wide, one hand on waist,
chin slightly lifted. Shot on an 85mm short telephoto lens for spatial compression. High-key studio
light sculpts facial planes and jewel accessories. Shoulder line drops in slight asymmetry for casual
luxury. Lip diffusion softens expression; cheekbones reflect matte peach fuzz under soft rim light.
Surface dust particles catch side-light in crisp microbloom. Refined, poised, commanding.
