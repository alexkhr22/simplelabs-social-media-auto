Reclining woman on seamless white void, arm stretched toward lens in surreal forced perspective.

Hand dominates foreground like a sculpture — warm neutral skin with natural creases,
microtextures, and soft tendon tension. Taupe almond nails glint subtly under soft white studio light.
Fingers adorned with pearl-gold rings, layered pearl bracelets resting against wrist curvature, each
bead catching diffused luster.

Body recedes in soft compression — white bodysuit clinging to form, gentle tension folds at rib,
shoulder, hip. Fabric reads satin-matte with anatomical fidelity. Face turned upward, eyes closed or
calm, under-eye hydrogel patches glistening. Hair fanned across white floor in organic curl spread.
Jewelry and skin tone balanced in warm editorial harmony.

Lit by overhead diffuse softboxes, no shadow falloff. Shot with 14mm wide-angle lens, Canon EOS
R5, f/4.5. Foreground in sharp focus, body subtly fading into depth, white void studio with matte
fiber floor, no environmental texture. Atmosphere clean, surgical. Emotion: tranquil poise, softness
with latent strength. Editorial calm, sculptural serenity.
