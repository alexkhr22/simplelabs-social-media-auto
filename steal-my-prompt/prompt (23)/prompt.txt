Framing & Pose · Tight mid-torso studio portrait, female subject centered. · Hood pulled low to eyebrow level, obscuring the eyes; head slightly tipped forward. · Both elbows lifted outward as hands grab the hood rim. · Mouth open in a snarl/grin; lower lip pulled down with left index finger to expose chrome grills on both jaws.
Wardrobe & Props · Oversized navy hoodie. · Chest graphic: large bubble-letter logotype in light blue with white outline and small yellow star accents (reads like “PROMPTS”). · Hood embroidery: small cursive wordmark in white on the left side. · Thin gold bracelet on left wrist; multiple mixed rings on both hands (gold tones), including a heart, signet, and geometric shapes.
Body & Details · Medium skin tone with natural texture; faint shine on nose tip and upper lip. · Tattoos: left hand: stylized eye on back of hand; small characters/marks on fingers. · Neck, center: small word “made.” · Additional small symbols on right fingers. · Nails short with red polish on some fingers; slight chipping for realism. · Teeth covered with reflective chrome grills; inner mouth shows wet mucosa texture and pink gum line.
Hair & Hood · Straight dark hair peeks from under the hood on both sides. · Hood fabric is thick cotton fleece; visible knit grain and seam at crown; casts a deep shadow across upper face.
Lighting & Color · Clean studio light: soft frontal key slightly from camera left; gentle fill from right; minimal shadow under chin. · Background: flat saturated sky-blue seamless; no horizon, no texture. · Palette: navy + sky blue + white + yellow star pops; skin neutrals; silver grills; gold jewelry.
Mood · Streetwear editorial with playful defiance; intimate, brazen, confident energy.
Optics · Normal lens (~50mm) at moderate aperture so hands, mouth, hoodie logo all stay sharp; background soft but solid. · No visible grain; crisp digital finish.
