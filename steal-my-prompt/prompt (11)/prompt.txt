Prompt-
High-fashion cinematic editorial photography, shot on a Hasselblad H6D-100c with an 80mm lens at

f/2.8, captured from a mid-profile, waist-up angle that places the subjects dead-center of the frame
while the world moves past them. Lighting setup: natural overcast daylight diffused evenly across
the court, paired with a subtle directional bounce from camera left that gently lifts cheekbones and
jawlines, preserving true skin realism — visible pores, fine facial hair texture, soft under-eye
shadows, and natural skin sheen with zero smoothing. Color tone: muted concrete greys,
desaturated olive, soft beige skin tones inspired by A Bigger Splash and Call Me By Your Name
outdoor palettes, calm and emotionally restrained.

Subjects: two highly attractive models — one male and one female, mid-20s, sharp symmetrical
facial features, piercing eyes, composed expressions — standing completely still and unbothered.
Their faces are crisp and photorealistic, with perfect anatomy, no distortion, no warping, no
glitches. Clothing: loose-fit, old-money tailored suits in soft wool — relaxed blazers, fluid trousers,
understated elegance that contrasts the chaos around them. The suits drape naturally, with subtle
creases and fabric weight visible in motionless folds.

Background setting: a functioning outdoor basketball court in full activity — players running,
jumping, passing, and shooting, all rendered in clean, controlled motion blur from low-shutter
panning. The ball streaks slightly through the frame, sneakers smear across the painted court lines,
bodies blur into rhythmic movement — yet the two models remain sharply frozen, untouched by the
game, ignored by everyone around them. No one looks at them. No one reacts. Life continues
normally.

Pose: both models stand shoulder-to-shoulder, mid-profile to the camera, chins neutral, eyes
calmly directed toward the lens. Hands relaxed — one model lightly adjusting a blazer cuff, the other
resting fingers loosely at the side. Emotion: quiet dominance, inherited confidence, the stillness of

people who do not need attention to own the frame. Photographer style: Peter Lindbergh realism
fused with modern luxury editorial restraint. Vibe: old-money indifference in a moving world.

Post-processing: clean cinematic grading, soft contrast roll-off, preserved motion blur physics,
subtle film grain for tactility. No visual artifacts, no AI glitches, no distorted faces or bodies — pure
photorealistic editorial poster energy, designed to stop the scroll through calm alone.

High-fashion editorial photography, shot on a Hasselblad H6D-100c with an 80mm lens at f/2.8,
captured from a wide mid-body angle that frames both subjects against the geometry of an empty
outdoor basketball court. Lighting setup: soft overcast daylight acting as a natural diffusion layer,
paired with a subtle silver bounce from camera right to lift cheekbones and jawlines without killing
shadow depth. Color tone: muted taupe, stone grey, and desaturated olive inspired by The Talented
Mr. Ripley winter scenes. Subjects: one highly attractive male model and one highly attractive
female model, mid-20s, sharp symmetrical facial features, piercing eyes, real skin texture with
visible pores, micro-sheen, and natural imperfections preserved. Clothing: loose-fit tailored suits in
soft wool, slightly oversized blazers and relaxed trousers, draping effortlessly with old-money
restraint. Background: cracked concrete basketball court, faded white lines, rusted hoop blurred
into cinematic depth. Pose: seated casually on a courtside bench, shoulders relaxed, gazes
detached yet confident. Emotion: inherited calm, effortless privilege. Photographer style: Peter
Lindbergh realism meets modern luxury editorial. Post-process: soft contrast roll-off, fine grain, no
glitches, no distorted faces or bodies, pure photorealism.
