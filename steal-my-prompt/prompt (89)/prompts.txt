A man stands by a huge glass window
inside an empty airport terminal, sunset
light slicing through the glass, warm
orange beams hitting his skin, cool teal
shadows on marble floor, realistic pores
and skin oils visible, shallow depth of
field, Sony A7R V, 85 mm f/1.4 G-Master,
ISO 200, cinematic soft haze, film grain,
teal-orange color grade, photographed
