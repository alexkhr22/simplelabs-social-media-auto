Cinematic night portrait photography, shot on a Contax G2 with a 45mm lens at f/2.8, captured
using long exposure and single flash pop. Lighting setup: one flash exposure freezes the subject
while surrounding environment drifts into abstract motion. Color palette: warm amber trails, deep
charcoal blacks inspired by Paris, Texas night tones. Subject: male model, mid-20s, extremely
attractive, sharp facial symmetry, piercing eyes, realistic skin texture preserved in full detail.
Clothing: classic dark suit jacket worn open, subtle sheen under flash. Background: night sidewalk
with pedestrians blurring past. Pose: standing still, one hand adjusting jacket cuff. Emotion: timeless

solitude. Post-process: analog-style grain, soft highlight roll-off no glitches, no distortion, ultra-
clean photorealistic finish. --ar 4:5
